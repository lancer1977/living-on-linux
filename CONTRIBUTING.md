## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- **Python**: Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- **Indentation**: 4 spaces (no tabs)
- **Line length**: Maximum 88 characters (Black formatter default)
- **Naming**: Use descriptive variable and function names
- **Comments**: Add clear comments for complex logic

### Code Quality

- **Minimal dependencies**: Prefer built-in libraries over external packages
- **Error handling**: Implement comprehensive error checking
- **User feedback**: Provide clear status messages and progress indicators
- **Security**: Handle user input safely and avoid command injection
- **Performance**: Optimize for minimal resource usage

### Git Workflow

- Use descriptive commit messages
- Follow conventional commit format when possible:
  - `feat: add new feature`
  - `fix: resolve bug`
  - `docs: update documentation`
  - `refactor: improve code structure`
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Rebase your branch before submitting PRs
